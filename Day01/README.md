# What is React and purpose of React?

* React is a JS Library.
* React is used for creating User Interface.

# Can we build an entire web application with React only?

* No, because to create an entire application we need data base, server site application etc.

# Can we develop only front end app with React only?

* No.

* React + Other Libraries = Front end Application

* HTML + CSS = Static UI
* HTML + CSS + JS = Dynamic UI

* With React = Static and Dynamic UI both

# If we can create web apps using HTML, CSS and JS then why React came in picture?

1. We can not reuse the UI without React.
2. Need to write a lot of code to develop UI in JS.
3. Development process will be long in JS.
4. So, performance of the application will be slow.

* So, to overcome the above listed problems, Library or Framework came in picture.

# What is Library?

* Library is a collection of pre-defined functions or classes, or properties(variables).
* React is JS Library which provides some pre-defined functions, classes or properties to develop UI.
* In React, all the pre-defined functions, classes or properties are written in JS that's why React 
is a JS Library.

### Examples of Library:
* React, Redux, RXJS, JQuery, Bootstrap etc.

# What is Framework?

* Framework is a collection of Libraries which provides set of rules to develop an application.

### Examples of Framework:
* Angular, Vue JS, BackboneJS, Springboot or Spring, Django, Next JS, Express JS etc.

# Why is React so popular among all Libraris and Frameworks?

* React is simple and easy to learn.
* React is very small Library and learning curve is very small.
* React has a support of Facebook because Facebook has created React.
* React community is very big. So if you run into a problem with React then there is a lot of chances 
to get the solution of your problem.
* React provides reusability feature.
* React apllications are very very fast that's why the application peformance is good.
* Development process is very fast.
